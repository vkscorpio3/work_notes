JBoss 6

Locations:
/opt/oracle/commerce/common/bin/

restart-env.sh -e <environment name>  This is a ?wrapper? around the stop-env.sh and start-env.sh.  It will bounce all the instances for a given environment and return to the command line.
restart-env.sh -e prd1

start-env.sh -e <environment name>  This will start all instances for a given environment
start-env.sh -e prd1

stop-env.sh -e <environment name>  This wills stop all instances for a given environment
stop-env-sh -e prd1

restart-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will stop then start a single instance in a specific environment
restart-inst -e prd1 -i app1

start-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will start a single instance in a specific environment
start-inst.sh -e prd1 -i app1

stop-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will stop a single instance in a specific environment
stop-inst.sh -e prd1 -i app1

restart-env.sh -e <environment name>  This is a ?wrapper? around the stop-env.sh and start-env.sh.  It will bounce all the instances for a given environment and return to the command line.
restart-env.sh -e prd1

start-env.sh -e <environment name>  This will start all instances for a given environment
start-env.sh -e prd1

stop-env.sh -e <environment name>  This wills stop all instances for a given environment
stop-env-sh -e prd1

restart-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will stop then start a single instance in a specific environment
restart-inst -e prd1 -i app1

start-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will start a single instance in a specific environment
start-inst.sh -e prd1 -i app1

stop-inst.sh -e <environment name> -i <instance name>  This will stop a single instance in a specific environment
stop-inst.sh -e prd1 -i app1

refresh-configs.sh
    -a : update all envs on box
    -e <env> : update a specific environment, able to pass several
    -f : force updates, ignore svn conflicts
    -h : prints help message
    -n : include newrelic in update, bring it up to current version


JBoss 5
---------------------
restart-inst.sh <instance name>  This script is a ?wrapper? around the stop-inst.sh and start-inst.sh scripts.  It will bounce a given instance and return to the command line.
restart-inst.sh app1

stop-inst.sh -s <instance name>  This will stop a given instance.  It will wait for 10 minutes and if the instance is not stopped will issue a kill -9 on the pid. Think of the -s flag as ?stop"
stop-inst.sh -s app1

start-inst.sh <instance name>  This will start a given instance. Think of the -c flag as "continue"
start-inst.sh -c app1

You will see other variations across the environments:
stop-all.sh  Stops all running instances (ones that have a proper jboss-conf symlink)
start-all.sh
restart-all.sh

Be somewhat careful with the start-all or restart all since firing up 3-4 instances will put a decent load on the db as they load up caches etc.

update-configs.sh   This will push the customers svn config layer.
update-configs.sh


Apps that Need Multiple Restarts
---------------------
Thread and heap dumps may be collected from apps that need to be restarted more than once,
customers may request them.
